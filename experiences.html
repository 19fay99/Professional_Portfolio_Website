                    <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Throughout my years in college I have learned many programming languages including Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, and even some SystemVerilog to integrate custom software and write it to a piece of hardware.</p>

                </div>
                <p>While attending college I thought it would be natural to have a concentration in game design to further establish my programming abilities, and in the process made some games I am truly proud of.</p>

                </div>
                <p>My team had created a mock database for the St. Johnsbury Country Club in order to keep track of the club members basic information, along with the dinners they would order for specific events held at the country club.</p>

                    <h3>Printed Circuit Boards</h3>
                </div>
                <p>In high school I learned how to create PCB's by making a schematic. I would then design and simulate the circuit in Multisim, use a milling machine to cut out the copper boards based on the Multisim design, 
                    and lastly solder components to the boards I had created.</p>
