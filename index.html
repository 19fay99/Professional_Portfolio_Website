            Hello! I am <strong>Andrew Fay</strong>
        </h1>
        <p class="sectionSubtitle sectionSubtitleIntro">full-time student</p>
        <p class = "para1">I am a passionate computer science student with a deeper interest in hardware and its integration with software capabilities. 
            I love solving complex problems and find value in the successes that are born from the failures I have endured. 
            Although I do not have much experience in the field, I can assure you that the projects I have completed shaped me into an adequate and engaged learner. 
            My curiosity knows no bounds, and I donâ€™t hesitate to ask questions when I am eager to find out how things function.</p>

    <!--About Me-->
    <section class = "aboutMe" id="about">
        <h2 class = "sectionTitle sectionTitleAbout"> Who I Am</h2>
        <p class = "sectionSubtitle sectionSubtitleAbout">part-time meat slicer</p>

        <div class="aboutMeBody">
            <p class = "para2"> My background and inspiration to pursue a career in computer science began in high school as I took a four-year electronics course where we learned the basics of analog and digital components, 
                and completed fun projects where we put our knowledge to the test. 
                It was satisfying seeing something I created with my own two hands come to life and either succeed or fail based on my implementation.
            </p>
            <p class = "para3"> Throughout my four years in college, I have worked at Market Basket in the deli department to make ends meet (no pun intended). 
                Over the years there I have learned hard work and determination go a long way, having to deal with difficult customers and finding solutions to everyday problems. 
            </p>
            <p class = "para4"> When I am not working, I enjoy being active by either going to the gym or going for walks, usually dependent on the ever-changing weather on the east coast. 
                Some hobbies I enjoy are working on my car, photography, fishing, drawing, and playing video games.
